# WeatherApp
This is my first Weather API Project.

API used: openweathermap.org (not paid or subscribed) <br>
Made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br> <br>
I just finished with my second semester examinations and planned to make a few projects during this summer vacation. Well, this is the first one.
